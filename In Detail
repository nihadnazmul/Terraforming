At fiest we need to know about the mechanism of man made leaf
Julian Melchiorri a student of royal college of arts managed to stabilize the chlorophyll got from leaf.
He used silk protin collected from silk fiber and make matrix of that chlorophyll 
We will use the that matrix solution 
We wear dress. 
To materialize our project we will take a silk dress.
Dresses are made after completing a lot of process.
Dyeing is one of them.
During the dying there used a lot of dye stuff to color.
Those are Amonium based chemicals
What we will do is to extract the chlorophyl from the plant tree by normal solution precess of leafs in water.
The protin that stabilize the chloroplyl to fucntion the synthesis will be applied from the fabric of the dress itself.
Then the result will be a alive dress that will actively absorb CO2 and vapour that is present in the humid atmosphere.
